\im This Book is so called from a Greek word that signifies a preacher: because, like an excellent preacher, it gives admirable lessons of all virtues. The author was Jesus the son of Sirach of Jerusalem, who flourished about two hundred years before Christ. As it was written after the time of Esdras, it is not in the Jewish canon; but is received as canonical and divine by the Catholic Church, instructed by apostolical tradition, and directed by the spirit of God. It was first written in the Hebrew, but afterwards translated into Greek, by another Jesus, the grandson of the author, whose prologue to this book is the following:
\c 1
\cl The Prologue.
\p
The knowledge of many and great things hath been shewn us by the law, and the prophets, and others that have followed them: for which things Israel is to be commended for doctrine and wisdom, because not only they that speak must needs be skilful, but strangers also, both speaking and writing, may by their means become most learned.
\p
My grandfather Jesus, after he had much given himself to a diligent reading of the law, and the prophets, and other books, that were delivered to us from our fathers, had a mind also to write something himself, pertaining to doctrine and wisdom; that such as are desirous to learn, and are made knowing in these things, may be more and more attentive in mind, and be strengthened to live according to the law.
\p
I entreat you therefore to come with benevolence, and to read with attention, and to pardon us for those things wherein we may seem, while we follow the image of wisdom, to come short in the composition of words; for the Hebrew words have not the same force in them when translated into another tongue.
\p
And not only these, but the law also itself, and the prophets, and the rest of the books, have no small difference, when they are spoken in their own language. For in the eight and thirtieth year coming into Egypt, when Ptolemy Evergetes was king, and continuing there a long time, I found there books left, of no small nor contemptible learning.
\p
Therefore I thought it good, and necessary for me to bestow some diligence and labour to interpret this book; and with much watching and study in some space of time, I brought the book to an end, and set it forth for the service of them that are willing to apply their mind, and to learn how they ought to conduct themselves, who purpose to lead their life according to the law of the Lord.
\cl Ecclesiasticus 1
\cd All wisdom is from God, and is given to them that fear and love God.
\p
\v 1 All wisdom is from the Lord God, and hath been always with him, and is before all time.
\p
\v 2 Who hath numbered the sand of the sea, and the drops of rain, and the days of the world? Who hath measured the height of heaven, and the breadth of the earth, and the depth of the abyss?
\p
\v 3 Who hath searched out the wisdom of God that goeth before all things?
\p
\v 4 Wisdom hath been created before all things, and the understanding of prudence from everlasting.
\p
\v 5 The word of God on high is the fountain of wisdom, and her ways are everlasting commandments.
\p
\v 6 To whom hath the root of wisdom been revealed, and who hath known her wise counsels?
\p
\v 7 To whom hath the discipline of wisdom been revealed and made manifest? and who hath understood the multiplicity of her steps?
\p
\v 8 There is one most high Creator Almighty, and a powerful king, and greatly to be feared, who sitteth upon his throne, and is the God of dominion.
\p
\v 9 He created her in the Holy Ghost, and saw her, and numbered her, and measured her.
\p
\v 10 And he poured her out upon all his works, and upon all flesh according to his gift, and hath given her to them that love him.
\p
\v 11 The fear of the Lord is honour, and glory, and gladness, and a crown of joy.
\p
\v 12 The fear of the Lord shall delight the heart, and shall give joy, and gladness, and length of days.
\p
\v 13 With him that feareth the Lord, it shall go well in the latter end, and in the day of his death he shall be blessed.
\p
\v 14 The love of God is honourable wisdom.
\p
\v 15 And they to whom she shall shew herself love her by the sight, and by the knowledge of her great works.
\p
\v 16 The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and was created with the faithful in the womb, it walketh with chosen women, and is known with the just and faithful.
\p
\v 17 The fear of the Lord is the religiousness of knowledge.
\p
\v 18 Religiousness shall keep and justify the heart, it shall give joy and gladness.
\p
\v 19 It shall go well with him that feareth the Lord, and in the days of his end he shall be blessed.
\p
\v 20 To fear God is the fulness of wisdom, and fulness is from the fruits thereof.
\p
\v 21 She shall fill all her house with her increase, and the storehouses with her treasures.
\p
\v 22 The fear of the Lord is a crown of wisdom, filling up peace and the fruit of salvation:
\p
\v 23 And it hath seen, and numbered her: but both are the gifts of God.
\p
\v 24 Wisdom shall distribute knowledge, and understanding of prudence: and exalteth the glory of them that hold her.
\p
\v 25 The root of wisdom is to fear the Lord: and the branches thereof are long-lived.
\p
\v 26 In the treasures of wisdom is understanding, and religiousness of knowledge: but to sinners wisdom is an abomination.
\p
\v 27 The fear of the Lord driveth out sin:
\p
\v 28 For he that is without fear, cannot be justified: for the wrath of his high spirits is his ruin.
\p
\v 29 A patient man shall bear for a time, and afterwards joy shall be restored to him.
\p
\v 30 A good understanding will hide his words for a time, and the lips of many shall declare his wisdom.
\p
\v 31 In the treasures of wisdom is the signification of discipline:
\p
\v 32 But the worship of God is an abomination to a sinner.
\p
\v 33 Son, if thou desire wisdom, keep justice, and God will give her to thee.
\p
\v 34 For the fear of the Lord is wisdom and discipline: and that which is agreeable to him,
\p
\v 35 Is faith, and meekness: and he will fill up his treasures.
\p
\v 36 Be not incredulous to the fear of the Lord: and come not to him with a double heart.
\p
\v 37 Be not a hypocrite in the sight of men, and let not thy lips be a stumblingblock to thee.
\p
\v 38 Watch over them, lest thou fall, and bring dishonour upon thy soul,
\p
\v 39 And God discover thy secrets, and cast thee down in the midst of the congregation.
\p
\v 40 Because thou camest to the Lord wickedly, and thy heart is full of guile and deceit.
\c 2
\cl Ecclesiasticus 2
\cd God's servants must look for temptations: and must arm themselves with patience and confidence in God.
\p
\v 1 Son, when thou comest to the service of God, stand in justice and in fear, and prepare thy soul for temptation.
\p
\v 2 Humble thy heart, and endure: incline thy ear, and receive the words of understanding: and make not haste in the time of clouds.
\p
\v 3 Wait on God with patience: join thyself to God, and endure, that thy life may be increased in the latter end.
\p
\v 4 Take all that shall be brought upon thee: and in thy sorrow endure, and in thy humiliation keep patience.
\p
\v 5 For gold and silver are tried in the fire, but acceptable men in the furnace of humiliation.
\p
\v 6 Believe God, and he will recover thee: and direct thy way, and trust in him. Keep his fear, and grow old therein.
\p
\v 7 Ye that fear the Lord, wait for his mercy: and go not aside from him lest ye fall.
\p
\v 8 Ye that fear the Lord, believe him: and your reward shall not be made void.
\p
\v 9 Ye that fear the Lord hope in him, and mercy shall come to you for your delight.
\p
\v 10 Ye that fear the Lord, love him, and your hearts shall be enlightened.
\p
\v 11 My children behold the generations of men: and know ye that no one hath hoped in the Lord, and hath been confounded.
\p
\v 12 For who hath continued in his commandment, and hath been forsaken? or who hath called upon him, and he despised him?
\p
\v 13 For God is compassionate and merciful, and will forgive sins in the day of tribulation: and he is a protector to all that seek him in truth.
\p
\v 14 Woe to them that are of a double heart and to wicked lips, and to the hands that do evil, and to the sinner that goeth on the earth two ways.
\p
\v 15 Woe to them that are fainthearted, who believe not God: and therefore they shall not be protected by him.
\p
\v 16 Woe to them that have lost patience, and that have forsaken the right ways, and have gone aside into crooked ways.
\p
\v 17 And what will they do, when the Lord shall begin to examine?
\p
\v 18 They that fear the Lord, will not be incredulous to his word: and they that love him, will keep his way.
\p
\v 19 They that fear the Lord, will seek after the things that are well pleasing to him: and they that love him, shall be filled with his law.
\p
\v 20 They that fear the Lord, will prepare their hearts, and in his sight will sanctify their souls,
\p
\v 21 They that fear the Lord, keep his commandments, and will have patience even until his visitation,
\p
\v 22 Saying: If we do not penance, we shall fall into the hands of the Lord, and not into the hands of men.
\p
\v 23 For according to his greatness, so also is his mercy with him.

\cd Lessons concerning the honour of parents, and humility, and avoiding curiosity.
\p
\v 1 The sons of wisdom are the church of the just: and their generation, obedience and love.
\p
\v 2 Children, hear the judgment of your father, and so do that you may be saved.
\p
\v 3 For God hath made the father honourable to the children: and seeking the judgment of the mothers, hath confirmed it upon the children.
\p
\v 4 He that loveth God, shall obtain pardon for his sins by prayer, and shall refrain himself from them, and shall be heard in the prayer of days.
\p
\v 5 And he that honoureth his mother is as one that layeth up a treasure.
\p
\v 6 He that honoureth his father shall have joy in his own children, and in the day of his prayer he shall be heard.
\p
\v 7 He that honoureth his father shall enjoy a long life: and he that obeyeth the father, shall be a comfort to his mother.
\p
\v 8 He that feareth the Lord, honoureth his parents, and will serve them as his masters that brought him into the world.
\p
\v 9 Honour thy father, in work and word, and all patience,
\p
\v 10 That a blessing may come upon thee from him, and his blessing may remain in the latter end.
\p
\v 11 The father's blessing establisheth the houses of the children: but the mother's curse rooteth up the foundation.
\p
\v 12 Glory not in the dishonour of thy father: for his shame is no glory to thee.
\p
\v 13 For the glory of a man is from the honour of his father, and a father without honour is the disgrace of the son.
\p
\v 14 Son, support the old age of thy father, and grieve him not in his life;
\p
\v 15 And if his understanding fail, have patience with him, and despise him not when thou art in thy strength: for the relieving of the father shall not be forgotten.
\p
\v 16 For good shall be repaid to thee for the sin of thy mother.
\p
\v 17 And in justice thou shalt be built up, and in the day of affliction thou shalt be remembered: and thy sins shall melt away as the ice in the fair warm weather.
\p
\v 18 Of what an evil fame is he that forsaketh his father: and he is cursed of God that angereth his mother.
\p
\v 19 My son, do thy works in meekness, and thou shalt be beloved above the glory of men.
\p
\v 20 The greater thou art, the more humble thyself in all things, and thou shalt find grace before God:
\p
\v 21 For great is the power of God alone, and he is honoured by the humble.
\p
\v 22 Seek not the things that are too high for thee, and search not into things above thy ability: but the things that God hath commanded thee, think on them always, and in many of his works be not curious.
\p
\v 23 For it is not necessary for thee to see with thy eyes those things that are hid.
\p
\v 24 In unnecessary matters be not over curious, and in many of his works thou shalt not be inquisitive.
\p
\v 25 For many things are shewn to thee above the understanding of men.
\p
\v 26 And the suspicion of them hath deceived many, and hath detained their minds in vanity.
\p
\v 27 A hard heart shall fear evil at the last: and he that loveth danger shall perish in it.
\p
\v 28 A heart that goeth two ways shall not have success, and the perverse of heart shall be scandalized therein.
\p
\v 29 A wicked heart shall be laden with sorrows, and the sinner will add sin to sin.
\p
\v 30 The congregation of the proud shall not be healed: for the plant of wickedness shall take root in them, and it shall not be perceived.
\p
\v 31 The heart of the wise is understood in wisdom, and a good ear will hear wisdom with all desire.
\p
\v 32 A wise heart, and which hath understanding, will abstain from sins, and in the works of justice shall have success.
\p
\v 33 Water quencheth a flaming fire, and alms resisteth sins:
\p
\v 34 And God provideth for him that sheweth favour: he remembereth him afterwards, and in the time of his fall he shall find a sure stay.

\cl Ecclesiasticus 4
\cd An exhortation to works of mercy, and to the love of wisdom.
\p
\v 1 Son, defraud not the poor of alms, and turn not away thy eyes from the poor.
\p
\v 2 Despise not the hungry soul: and provoke not the poor in his want.
\p
\v 3 Afflict not the heart of the needy, and defer not to gibe to him that is in distress.
\p
\v 4 Reject not the petition of the afflicted: and turn not away thy face from the needy.
\p
\v 5 Turn not away thy eyes from the poor for fear of anger: and leave not to them that ask of thee to curse thee behind thy back.
\p
\v 6 For the prayer of him that curseth thee in the bitterness of his soul, shall be heard, for he that made him will hear him.
\p
\v 7 Make thyself affable to the congregation of the poor, and humble thy soul to the ancient, and bow thy head to a great man.
\p
\v 8 Bow down thy ear cheerfully to the poor, and pay what thou owest, and answer him peaceable words with mildness.
\p
\v 9 Deliver him that suffereth wrong out of the hand of the proud: and be not fainthearted in thy soul.
\p
\v 10 In judging be merciful to the fatherless as a father, and as a husband to their mother.
\p
\v 11 And thou shalt be as the obedient son of the most High, and he will have mercy on thee more than a mother.
\p
\v 12 Wisdom inspireth life into her children, and protecteth them that seek after her, and will go before them in the way of justice.
\p
\v 13 And he that loveth her, loveth life: and they that watch for her, shall embrace her sweetness.
\p
\v 14 They that hold her fast, shall inherit life: and whithersoever she entereth, God will give a blessing.
\p
\v 15 They that serve her, shall be servants to the holy one: and God loveth them that love her.
\p
\v 16 He that hearkeneth to her, shall judge nations: and he that looketh upon her, shall remain secure.
\p
\v 17 If he trust to her, he shall inherit her, and his generation shall be in assurance.
\p
\v 18 For she walketh with him in temptation, and at the first she chooseth him.\f + \fr 4:18 \fk In temptation: \ft The meaning is, that before wisdom will choose any for her favourite, she will try them by leading them through contradictions, afflictions, and temptations, the usual noviceship of the children of God.\f*
\p
\v 19 She will bring upon him fear and dread and trial: and she will scourge him with the affliction of her discipline, till she try him by her laws, and trust his soul.
\p
\v 20 Then she will strengthen him, and make a straight way to him, and give him joy,
\p
\v 21 And will disclose her secrets to him, and will heap upon him treasures of knowledge and understanding of justice.
\p
\v 22 But if he go astray, she will forsake him, and deliver him into the hands of his enemy.
\p
\v 23 Son, observe the time, and fly from evil.
\p
\v 24 For thy soul be not ashamed to say the truth.
\p
\v 25 For there is a shame that bringeth sin, and there is a shame that bringeth glory and grace.
\p
\v 26 Accept no person against thy own person, nor against thy soul a lie.
\p
\v 27 Reverence not thy neighbour in his fall:
\p
\v 28 And refrain not to speak in the time of salvation. Hide not thy wisdom in her beauty.
\p
\v 29 For by the tongue wisdom is discerned: and understanding, and knowledge, and learning by the word of the wise, and steadfastness in the works of justice.
\p
\v 30 In nowise speak against the truth, but be ashamed of the lie of thy ignorance.
\p
\v 31 Be not ashamed to confess thy sins, but submit not thyself to every man for sin.
\p
\v 32 Resist not against the face of the mighty, and do not strive against the stream of the river.
\p
\v 33 Strive for justice for thy soul, and even unto death fight for justice, and God will overthrow thy enemies for thee.
\p
\v 34 Be not hasty in thy tongue: and slack and remiss in thy works.
\p
\v 35 Be not as a lion in thy house, terrifying them of thy household, and oppressing them that are under thee.
\p
\v 36 Let not thy hand be stretched out to receive, and shut when thou shouldst give.
\c 5
\cl Ecclesiasticus 5
\cd We must not presume of our wealth or strength: nor of the mercy of God, to go on in sin: we must be steadfast in virtue and truth.
\p
\v 1 Set not thy heart upon unjust possessions, and say not: I have enough to live on: for it shall be of no service in the time of vengeance and darkness.
\p
\v 2 Follow not in thy strength the desires of thy heart:
\p
\v 3 And say not: How mighty am I? and who shall bring me under for my deeds? for God will surely take revenge.
\p
\v 4 Say not: I have sinned, and what harm hath befallen me? for the most High is a patient rewarder.
\p
\v 5 Be not without fear about sin forgiven, and add not sin upon sin:
\p
\v 6 And say not: The mercy of the Lord is great, he will have mercy on the multitude of my sins.
\p
\v 7 For mercy and wrath quickly come from him, and his wrath looketh upon sinners.
\p
\v 8 Delay not to be converted to the Lord, and defer it not from day to day.
\p
\v 9 For his wrath shall come on a sudden, and in the time of vengeance he will destroy thee.
\p
\v 10 Be not anxious for goods unjustly gotten: for they shall not profit thee in the day of calamity and revenge.
\p
\v 11 Winnow not with every wind, and go not into every way: for so is every sinner proved by a double tongue.
\p
\v 12 Be steadfast in the way of the Lord, and in the truth of thy judgment, and in knowledge, and let the word of peace and justice keep with thee.
\p
\v 13 Be meek to hear the word, that thou mayst understand: and return a true answer with wisdom.
\p
\v 14 If thou have understanding, answer thy neighbour: but if not, let thy hand be upon thy mouth, lest thou be surprised in an unskilful word, and be confounded.
\p
\v 15 Honour and glory is in the word of the wise, but the tongue of the fool is his ruin.
\p
\v 16 Be not called a whisperer, and be not taken in thy tongue, and confounded.
\p
\v 17 For confusion and repentance is upon a thief, and an evil mark of disgrace upon the double tongued, but to the whisperer hatred, and enmity, and reproach.
\p
\v 18 Justify alike the small and the great.
\c 6
\cl Ecclesiasticus 6
\cd Of true and false friends: and of the of the fruits of wisdom.
\p
\v 1 Instead of a friend become not an enemy to thy neighbour: for an evil man shall inherit reproach and shame, so shall every sinner that is envious and double tongued.
\p
\v 2 Extol not thyself in the thoughts of thy soul like a bull: lest thy strength be quashed by folly,
\p
\v 3 And it eat up thy leaves, and destroy thy fruit, and thou be left as a dry tree in the wilderness.
\p
\v 4 For a wicked soul shall destroy him that hath it, and maketh him to be a joy to his enemies, and shall lead him into the lot of the wicked.
\p
\v 5 A sweet word multiplieth friends, and appeaseth enemies, and a gracious tongue in a good man aboundeth.
\p
\v 6 Be in peace with many, but let one of a thousand be thy counsellor.
\p
\v 7 If thou wouldst get a friend, try him before thou takest him, and do not credit him easily.
\p
\v 8 For there is a friend for his own occasion, and he will not abide in the day of thy trouble.
\p
\v 9 And there is a friend that turneth to enmity; and there is a friend that will disclose hatred and strife and reproaches.
\p
\v 10 And there is a friend a companion at the table, and he will not abide in the day of distress.
\p
\v 11 A friend if he continue steadfast, shall be to thee as thyself, and shall act with confidence among them of thy household.
\p
\v 12 If he humble himself before thee, and hide himself from thy face, thou shalt have unanimous friendship for good.
\p
\v 13 Separate thyself from thy enemies, and take heed of thy friends.
\p
\v 14 A faithful friend is a strong defence: and he that hath found him, hath found a treasure.
\p
\v 15 Nothing can be compared to a faithful friend, and no weight of gold and silver is able to countervail the goodness of his fidelity.
\p
\v 16 A faithful friend is the medicine of life and immortality: and they that fear the Lord, shall find him.
\p
\v 17 He that feareth God, shall likewise have good friendship: because according to him shall his friend be.
\p
\v 18 My son, from thy youth up receive instruction, and even to thy grey hairs thou shalt find wisdom.
\p
\v 19 Come to her as one that plougheth, and soweth, and wait for her good fruits:
\p
\v 20 For in working about her thou shalt labour a little, and shalt quickly eat of her fruits.
\p
\v 21 How very unpleasant is wisdom to the unlearned, and the unwise will not continue with her.
\p
\v 22 She shall be to them as a mighty stone of trial, and they will cast her from them before it be long.
\p
\v 23 For the wisdom of doctrine is according to her name, and she is not manifest unto many, but with them to whom she is known, she continueth even to the sight of God.
\p
\v 24 Give ear, my son, and take wise counsel, and cast not away my advice.
\p
\v 25 Put thy feet into her fetters, and thy neck into her chains:

\p
\v 27 Come to her with all thy mind, and keep her ways with all thy power.
\p
\v 28 Search for her, and she shall be made known to thee, and when thou hast gotten her, let her not go:
\p
\v 29 For in the latter end thou shalt find rest in her, and she shall be turned to thy joy.
\p
\v 30 Then shall her fetters be a strong defence for thee, and a firm foundation, and her chain a robe of glory:
\p
\v 31 For in her is the beauty of life, and her bands are a healthful binding.
\p
\v 32 Thou shalt put her on as a robe of glory, and thou shalt set her upon thee as a crown of joy.
\p
\v 33 My son, if thou wilt attend to me, thou shalt learn: and if thou wilt apply thy mind, thou shalt be wise.
\p
\v 34 If thou wilt incline thy ear, thou shalt receive instruction: and if thou love to hear, thou shalt be wise.
\p

\p
\v 36 And if thou see a man of understanding, go to him early in the morning, and let thy foot wear the steps of his doors.

\p
\v 8 Rejoice not at the death of thy enemy; knowing that we all die, and are not willing that others should rejoice at our death.
\p
\v 9 Despise not the discourse of them that are ancient and wise, but acquaint thyself with their proverbs.
\p
\v 10 For of them thou shalt learn wisdom, and instruction of understanding, and to serve great men without blame.
\p
\v 11 Let not the discourse of the ancients escape thee, for they have learned of their fathers:
\p
\v 12 For of them thou shalt learn understanding, and to give an answer in time of need.
\p
\v 13 Kindle not the coals of sinners by rebuking them, lest thou be burnt with the flame of the fire of their sins.
\p
\v 14 Stand not against the face of an injurious person, lest he sit as a spy to entrap thee in thy words.
\p
\v 15 Lend not to a man that is mightier than thyself: and if thou lendest, count it as lost.

\v 17 Judge not against a judge: for he judgeth according to that which is just.

\p
\v 6 Give not thy soul to harlots in any point: lest thou destroy thyself and thy inheritance.
\p

\p
\v 8 Turn away thy face from a woman dressed up, and gaze not about upon another's beauty.
\p
\v 9 For many have perished by the beauty of a woman, and hereby lust is enkindled as a fire.
\p
\v 10 Every woman that is a harlot, shall be trodden upon as dung in the way.

\v 7 Pride is hateful before God and men: and all iniquity of nations is execrable.
\p
\v 8 A kingdom is translated from one people to another, because of injustices, and wrongs, and injuries, and divers deceits.
\p
\v 9 But nothing is more wicked than the covetous man. Why is earth, and ashes proud?
\p
\v 10 There is not a more wicked thing than to love money: for such a one setteth even his own soul to sale: because while he liveth he hath cast away his bowels.
\p
\v 11 All power is of short life. A long sickness is troublesome to the physician.
\p
\v 12 The physician cutteth off a short sickness: so also a king is to day, and to morrow he shall die.

\v 13 For when a man shall die, he shall inherit serpents, and beasts, and worms.
\p
\v 14 The beginning of the pride of man, is to fall off from God:
\p
\v 15 Because his heart is departed from him that made him: for pride is the beginning of all sin: he that holdeth it, shall be filled with maledictions, and it shall ruin him in the end.
\p
\v 16 Therefore hath the Lord disgraced the assemblies of the wicked, and hath utterly destroyed them.
\p
\v 17 God hath overturned the thrones of proud princes, and hath set up the meek in their stead.
\p
\v 18 God hath made the roots of proud nations to wither, and hath planted the humble of these nations.
\p
\v 19 The Lord hath overthrown the lands of the Gentiles, and hath destroyed them even to the foundation.
\p
\v 20 He hath made some of them to wither away, and hath destroyed them, and hath made the memory of them to cease from the earth.
\p
\v 21 God hath abolished the memory of the proud, and hath preserved the memory of them that are humble in mind.
\p
\v 22 Pride was not made for men: nor wrath for the race of women.
\p
\v 23 That seed of men shall be honoured, which feareth God: but that seed shall be dishonoured, which transgresseth the commandments of the Lord.
\p
\v 24 In the midst of brethren their chief is honourable: so shall they that fear the Lord, be in his eyes.
\p
\v 25 The fear of God is the glory of the rich, and of the honourable, and of the poor.

\v 26 Despise not a just man that is poor, and do not magnify a sinful man that is rich.
\p
\v 27 The great man, and the judge, and the mighty is in honour: and there is none greater than he that feareth God.
\p
\v 28 They that are free shall serve a servant that is wise: and a man that is prudent and well instructed will not murmur when he is reproved; and he that is ignorant, shall not be honoured.

\p
\v 2 Praise not a man for his beauty, neither despise a man for his look.
\p
\v 3 The bee is small among flying things but her fruit hath the chiefest sweetness.
\p
\v 4 Glory not in apparel at any time, and be not exalted in the day of thy honour: for the works of the Highest only are wonderful, and his works are glorious, and secret, and hidden.
\p
\v 5 Many tyrants have sat on the throne, and he whom no man would think on, hath worn the crown.
\p
\v 6 Many mighty men have been greatly brought down, and the glorious have been delivered into the hand of others.
\p
\v 7 Before thou inquire, blame no man: and when thou hast inquired, reprove justly.
\p
\v 8 Before thou hear, answer not a word: and interrupt not others in the midst of their discourse.
\p
\v 9 Strive not in a matter which doth not concern thee, and sit not in judgment with sinners.
\p
\v 10 My son, meddle not with many matters: and if thou be rich, thou shalt not be free from sin: for if thou pursue after thou shalt not overtake; and if thou run before thou shalt not escape.
\p
\v 11 There is an ungodly man that laboureth, and maketh haste, and is in sorrow, and is so much the more in want.
\p
\v 12 Again, there is an inactive man that wanteth help, is very weak in ability, and full of poverty:
\p
\v 13 Yet the eye of God hath looked upon him for good, and hath lifted him up from his low estate, and hath exalted his head: and many have wondered at him, and have glorified God.
\p
\v 14 Good things and evil, life and death, poverty and riches, are from God.
\p
\v 15 Wisdom and discipline, and the knowledge of the law are with God. Love and the ways of good things are with him.
\p
\v 16 Error and darkness are created with sinners: and they that glory in evil things, grow old in evil.
\p
\v 17 The gift of God abideth with the just, and his advancement shall have success for ever.
\p
\v 18 There is one that is enriched by living sparingly, and this is the portion of his reward.
\p
\v 19 In that he saith: I have found me rest, and now I will eat of my goods alone:
\p
\v 20 And he knoweth not what time shall pass, and that death approacheth, and that he must leave all to others, and shall die.
\p
\v 21 Be steadfast in thy covenant, and be conversant therein, and grow old in the work of thy commandments.
\p
\v 22 Abide not in the works of sinners. But trust in God, and stay in thy place,
\p
\v 23 For it is easy in the eyes of God on a sudden to make the poor man rich.
\p
\v 24 The blessing of God maketh haste to reward the just, and in a swift hour his blessing beareth fruit.
\p
\v 25 Say not: What need I, and what good shall I have by this?
\p
\v 26 Say not: I am sufficient for myself: and what shall I be made worse by this?
\p
\v 27 In the day of good things be not unmindful of evils: and in the day of evils be not unmindful of good things:
\p
\v 28 For it is easy before God in the day of death to reward every one according to his ways.
\p

\v 31 Bring not every man into thy house: for many are the snares of the deceitful.
\p

\v 2 Do good to the just, and thou shalt find great recompense: and if not of him, assuredly of the Lord.

\p
\v 3 Lest my ignorances increase, and my offences be multiplied, and my sins abound, and I fall before my adversaries, and my enemy rejoice over me?
\p
\v 4 O Lord, father, and God of my life, leave me not to their devices.
\p
\v 5 Give me not haughtiness of my eyes, and turn away from me all coveting.
\p
\v 6 Take from me the greediness of the belly, and let not the lusts of the flesh take hold of me, and give me not over to a shameless and foolish mind.
\p
\v 7 Hear, O ye children, the discipline of the mouth, and he that will keep it shall not perish by his lips, nor be brought to fall into most wicked works.
\p
\v 8 A sinner is caught in his own vanity, and the proud and the evil speakers shall fall thereby.
\p
\v 9 Let not thy mouth be accustomed to swearing: for in it there are many falls.
\p
\v 10 And let not the naming of God be usual in thy mouth, and meddle not with the names of saints, for thou shalt not escape free from them.
\p
\v 11 For as a slave daily put to the question, is never without a blue mark: so every one that sweareth, and nameth, shall not be wholly pure from sin.
\p
\v 12 A man that sweareth much, shall be filled with iniquity, and a scourge shall not depart from his house.
\p
\v 13 And if he make it void, his sin shall be upon him, and if he dissemble it, he offendeth double:
\p
\v 14 And if he swear in vain, he shall not be justified: for his house shall be filled with his punishment.
\p
\v 15 There is also another speech opposite to death, let it not be found in the inheritance of Jacob.
\p
\v 16 For from the merciful all these things shall be taken away, and they shall not wallow in sins.
\p
\v 17 Let not thy mouth be accustomed to indiscreet speech: for therein is the word of sin.
\p
\v 18 Remember thy father and thy mother, for thou sittest in the midst of great men:
\p
\v 19 Lest God forget thee in their sight, and thou, by thy daily custom be infatuated and suffer reproach: and wish that thou hadst not been born, and curse the day of thy nativity.
\p
\v 20 The man that is accustomed to opprobrious words, will never be corrected all the days of his life.
\p
\v 21 Two sorts of men multiply sins, and the third bringeth wrath and destruction.
\p
\v 22 A hot soul is a burning fire, it will never be quenched, till it devour some thing.
\p
\v 23 And a man that is wicked in the mouth of his flesh, will not leave off till he hath kindled a fire.
\p
\v 24 To a man that is a fornicator all bread is sweet, he will not be weary of sinning unto the end.
\p
\v 25 Every man that passeth beyond his own bed, despising his own soul, and saying: Who seeth me?
\p
\v 26 Darkness compasseth me about, and the walls cover me, and no man seeth me: whom do I fear? the most High will not remember my sins.
\p
\v 27 And he understandeth not that his eye seeth all things, for such a man's fear driveth him from the fear of God, and the eyes of men fearing him:
\p
\v 28 And he knoweth not that the eyes of the Lord are far brighter than the sun, beholding round about all the ways of men, and the bottom of the deep, and looking into the hearts of men, into the most hidden parts.
\p
\v 29 For all things were known to the Lord God, before they were created: so also after they were perfected he beholdeth all things.
\p
\v 30 This man shall be punished in the streets of the city, and he shall be chased as a colt: and where he suspected not, he shall be taken.
\p
\v 31 And he shall be in disgrace with all men, because he understood not the fear of the Lord.
\p
\v 32 So every woman also that leaveth her husband, and bringeth in an heir by another:
\p
\v 33 For first she hath been unfaithful to the law of the most High: and secondly, she hath offended against her husband: thirdly, she hath fornicated in adultery, and hath gotten her children of another man.
\p
\v 34 This woman shall be brought into the assembly, and inquisition shall be made of her children.
\p
\v 35 Her children shall not take root, and her branches shall bring forth no fruit.

\cd Wisdom praiseth herself: her origin, her dwelling, her dignity, and her fruits.
\p
\v 1 Wisdom shall praise her own self, and shall be honoured in God, and shall glory in the midst of her people,
\p
\v 2 And shall open her mouth in the churches of the most High, and shall glorify herself in the sight of his power,
\p
\v 3 And in the midst of her own people she shall be exalted, and shall be admired in the holy assembly.
\p
\v 4 And in the multitude of the elect she shall have praise, and among the blessed she shall be blessed, saying:
\p
\v 5 I came out of the mouth of the most High, the firstborn before all creatures:
\p
\v 6 I made that in the heavens there should rise light that never faileth, and as a cloud I covered all the earth:
\p
\v 7 I dwelt in the highest places, and my throne is in a pillar of a cloud.
\p
\v 8 I alone have compassed the circuit of heaven, and have penetrated into the bottom of the deep, and have walked in the waves of the sea,
\p
\v 9 And have stood in all the earth: and in every people,
\p
\v 10 And in every nation I have had the chief rule:
\p
\v 11 And by my power I have trodden under my feet the hearts of all the high and low: and in all these I sought rest, and I shall abide in the inheritance of the Lord.
\p
\v 12 Then the creator of all things commanded, and said to me: and he that made me, rested in my tabernacle,
\p
\v 13 And he said to me: Let thy dwelling be in Jacob, and thy inheritance in Israel, and take root in my elect.
\p
\v 14 From the beginning, and before the world, was I created, and unto the world to come I shall not cease to be, and in the holy dwelling place I have ministered before him.
\p
\v 15 And so was I established in Sion, and in the holy city likewise I rested, and my power was in Jerusalem.
\p
\v 16 And I took root in an honourable people, and in the portion of my God his inheritance, and my abode is in the full assembly of saints.
\p
\v 17 I was exalted like a cedar in Libanus, and as a cypress tree on mount Sion.
\p
\v 18 I was exalted like a palm tree in Cades, and as a rose plant in Jericho:
\p
\v 19 As a fair olive tree in the plains, and as a plane tree by the water in the streets, was I exalted.
\p
\v 20 I gave a sweet smell like cinnamon, and aromatical balm: I yielded a sweet odour like the best myrrh:
\p
\v 21 And I perfumed my dwelling as storax, and galbanum, and onyx, and aloes, and as the frankincense not cut, and my odour is as the purest balm.
\p
\v 22 I have stretched out my branches as the turpentine tree, and my branches are of honour and grace.
\p
\v 23 As the vine I have brought forth a pleasant odour: and my flowers are the fruit of honour and riches.
\p
\v 24 I am the mother of fair love, and of fear, and of knowledge, and of holy hope.
\p
\v 25 In me is all grace of the way and of the truth, in me is all hope of life and of virtue.
\p
\v 26 Come over to me, all ye that desire me, and be filled with my fruits.
\p
\v 27 For my spirit is sweet above honey, and my inheritance above honey and the honeycomb.
\p
\v 28 My memory is unto everlasting generations.

\p

\p
\v 31 They that explain me shall have life everlasting.
\p
\v 32 All these things are the book of life, and the covenant of the most High, and the knowledge of truth.
\p
\v 33 Moses commanded a law in the precepts of justices, and an inheritance to the house of Jacob, and the promises to Israel.

\v 36 Who maketh understanding to abound as the Euphrates, who multiplieth it as the Jordan in the time of harvest.

\v 42 I said: I will water my garden of plants, and I will water abundantly the fruits of my meadow.
\p
\v 43 And behold my brook became a great river, and my river came near to a sea:
\p
\v 44 For I make doctrine to shine forth to all as the morning light, and I will declare it afar off.
\p
\v 45 I will penetrate to all the lower parts of the earth, and will behold all that sleep, and will enlighten all that hope in the Lord.
\p
\v 46 I will yet pour out doctrine as prophecy, and will leave it to them that seek wisdom, and will not cease to instruct their offspring even to the holy age.

\cd Documents of wisdom on several subjects.
\p
\v 1 With three things my spirit is pleased, which are approved before God and men:
\p
\v 2 The concord of brethren, and the love of neighbours, and man and wife that agree well together.
\p
\v 3 Three sorts my soul hateth, and I am greatly grieved at their life:
\p
\v 4 A poor man that is proud: a rich man that is a liar: an old man that is a fool, and doting.
\p
\v 5 The things that thou hast not gathered in thy youth, how shalt thou find them in thy old age?
\p
\v 6 O how comely is judgment for a grey head, and for ancients to know counsel!
\p
\v 7 O how comely is wisdom for the aged, and understanding and counsel to men of honour!
\p
\v 8 Much experience is the crown of old men, and the fear of God is their glory.
\p
\v 9 Nine things that are not to be imagined by the heart have I magnified, and the tenth I will utter to men with my tongue.
\p
\v 10 A man that hath joy of his children: and he that liveth and seeth the fall of his enemies.
\p
\v 11 Blessed is he that dwelleth with a wise woman, and that hath not slipped with his tongue, and that hath not served such as are unworthy of him.
\p
\v 12 Blessed is he that findeth a true friend, and that declareth justice to an ear that heareth.
\p
\v 13 How great is he that findeth wisdom and knowledge! but there is none above him that feareth the Lord.
\p
\v 14 The fear of God hath set itself above all things:
\p
\v 15 Blessed is the man, to whom it is given to have the fear of God: he that holdeth it, to whom shall he be likened?
\p
\v 16 The fear of God is the beginning of his love: and the beginning of faith is to be fast joined unto it.
\p
\v 17 The sadness of the heart is every plague: and the wickedness of a woman is all evil.
\p
\v 18 And a man will choose any plague, but the plague of the heart:
\p
\v 19 And any wickedness, but the wickedness of a woman:
\p
\v 20 And any affliction, but the affliction from them that hate him:
\p
\v 21 And any revenge, but the revenge of enemies.
\p
\v 22 There is no head worse than the head of a serpent:
\p
\v 23 And there is no anger above the anger of a woman. It will be more agreeable to abide with a lion and a dragon, than to dwell with a wicked woman.
\p
\v 24 The wickedness of a woman changeth her face: and she darkeneth her countenance as a bear: and sheweth it like sackcloth. In the midst of her neighbours,
\p
\v 25 Her husband groaned, and hearing he sighed a little.
\p
\v 26 All malice is short to the malice of a woman, let the lot of sinners fall upon her.
\p
\v 27 As the climbing of a sandy way is to the feet of the aged, so is a wife full of tongue to a quiet man.
\p
\v 28 Look not upon a woman's beauty, and desire not a woman for beauty.
\p
\v 29 A woman's anger, and impudence, and confusion is great.
\p
\v 30 A woman, if she have superiority, is contrary to her husband.
\p
\v 31 A wicked woman abateth the courage, and maketh a heavy countenance, and a wounded heart.
\p
\v 32 Feeble hands, and disjointed knees, a woman that doth not make her husband happy.
\p
\v 33 From the woman came the beginning of sin, and by her we all die.
\p
\v 34 Give no issue to thy water, no, not a little: nor to a wicked woman liberty to gad abroad.
\p
\v 35 If she walk not at thy hand, she will confound thee in the sight of thy enemies.
\p

\cl Ecclesiasticus 26
\cd Of good and bad women.

\v 2 A virtuous woman rejoiceth her husband, and shall fulfil the years of his life in peace.
\p
\v 3 A good wife is a good portion, she shall be given in the portion of them that fear God, to a man for his good deeds.
\p
\v 4 Rich or poor, if his heart is good, his countenance shall be cheerful at all times.
\p
\v 5 Of three things my heart hath been afraid, and at the fourth my face hath trembled:
\p
\v 6 The accusation of a city, and the gathering together of the people:
\p
\v 7 And a false calumny, all are more grievous than death.
\p
\v 8 A jealous woman is the grief and mourning of the heart.
\p
\v 9 With a jealous woman is a scourge of the tongue which communicateth with all.
\p
\v 10 As a yoke of oxen that is moved to and fro, so also is a wicked woman: he that hath hold of her, is as he that taketh hold of a scorpion.
\p
\v 11 A drunken woman is a great wrath: and her reproach and shame shall not be hid.
\p
\v 12 The fornication of a woman shall be known by the haughtiness of her eyes and by her eyelids.
\p
\v 13 On a daughter that turneth not away herself, set a strict watch: lest finding an opportunity she abuse herself.
\p
\v 14 Take heed of the impudence of her eyes, and wonder not if she slight thee.
\p
\v 15 She will open her mouth as a thirsty traveller to the fountain, and will drink of every water near her, and will sit down by every hedge, and open her quiver against every arrow, until she fail.
\p
\v 16 The grace of a diligent woman shall delight her husband, and shall fat his bones.
\p
\v 17 Her discipline is the gift of God.
\p
\v 18 Such is a wise and silent woman, and there is nothing so much worth as a well instructed soul.
\p
\v 19 A holy and shamefaced woman is grace upon grace.
\p
\v 20 And no price is worthy of a continent soul.
\p
\v 21 As the sun when it riseth to the world in the high places of God, so is the beauty of a good wife for the ornament of her house.
\p
\v 22 As the lamp shining upon the holy candlestick, so is the beauty of the face in a ripe age,
\p
\v 23 As golden pillars upon bases of silver, so are the firm feet upon the soles of a steady woman.
\p
\v 24 As everlasting foundations upon a solid rock, so the commandments of God in the heart of a holy woman.
\p
\v 25 At two things my heart is grieved, and the third bringeth anger upon me.
\p
\v 26 A man of war fainting through poverty, and a man of sense despised:
\p
\v 27 And he that passeth over from justice to sin, God hath prepared such an one for the sword.
\p
\v 28 Two sorts of callings have appeared to me hard and dangerous: a merchant is hardly free from negligence: and a huckster shall not be justified from the sins of the lips.\f + \fr 26:28 \fk From negligence: \ft That is, from the neglect of the service of God: because the eager pursuit of the mammon of this world, is apt to make men of that calling forget the great duties of loving God above all things, and their neighbours as themselves.\f*\f + \fr 26:28 \fk A huckster: \ft Or, a retailer of wine.

\p
\v 4 Unless thou hold thyself diligently in the fear of the Lord, thy house shall quickly be overthrown.
\p

\p

\p
\v 1 Every friend will say: I also am his friend: but there is a friend, that is only a friend in name. Is not this a grief even to death?
\p
\v 2 But a companion and a friend shall be turned to an enemy.
\p
\v 3 O wicked presumption, whence camest thou to cover the earth with thy malice, and deceitfulness?
\p
\v 4 There is a companion who rejoiceth with his friend in his joys, but in the time of trouble, he will be against him.
\p
\v 5 There is a companion who condoleth with his friend for his belly's sake, and he will take up a shield against the enemy.
\p
\v 6 Forget not thy friend in thy mind, and be not unmindful of him in thy riches.
\p
\v 7 Consult not with him that layeth a snare for thee, and hide thy counsel from them that envy thee.
\p
\v 8 Every counsellor giveth out counsel, but there is one that is a counsellor for himself.
\p
\v 9 Beware of a counsellor. And know before what need he hath: for he will devise to his own mind:
\p
\v 10 Lest he thrust a stake into the ground, and say to thee:
\p
\v 11 Thy way is good; and then stand on the other side to see what shall befall thee.
\p
\v 12 Treat not with a man without religion concerning holiness, nor with an unjust man concerning justice, nor with a woman touching her of whom she is jealous, nor with a coward concerning war, nor with a merchant about traffic, nor with a buyer of selling, nor with an envious man of giving thanks,
\p
\v 13 Nor with the ungodly of piety, nor with the dishonest of honesty, nor with the field laborer of every work,
\p
\v 14 Nor with him that worketh by the year of the finishing of the year, nor with an idle servant of much business: give no heed to these in any matter of counsel.
\p
\v 15 But be continually with a holy man, whomsoever thou shalt know to observe the fear of God,
\p
\v 16 Whose soul is according to thy own soul: and who, when thou shalt stumble in the dark, will be sorry for thee.
\p
\v 17 And establish within thyself a heart of good counsel: for there is no other thing of more worth to thee than it.
\p
\v 18 The soul of a holy man discovereth sometimes true things, more than seven watchmen that sit in a high place to watch.
\p
\v 19 But above all these things pray to the most High, that he may direct thy way in truth.
\p
\v 20 In all thy works let the true word go before thee, and steady counsel before every action.
\p
\v 21 A wicked word shall change the heart: out of which four manner of things arise, good and evil, life and death: and the tongue is continually the ruler of them. There is a man that is subtle and a teacher of many, and yet is unprofitable to his own soul.
\p
\v 22 A skilful man hath taught many, and is sweet to his own soul.
\p
\v 23 He that speaketh sophistically, is hateful: he shall be destitute of every thing.
\p
\v 24 Grace is not given him from the Lord: for he is deprived of all wisdom.
\p
\v 25 There is a wise man that is wise to his own soul: and the fruit of his understanding is commendable.
\p
\v 26 A wise man instructeth his own people, and the fruits of his understanding are faithful.

\v 30 My son, prove thy soul in thy life: and if it be wicked, give it no power:

\v 17 And for fear of being ill spoken of weep bitterly for a day, and then comfort thyself in thy sadness.
\p
\v 18 And make mourning for him according to his merit for a day, or two, for fear of detraction.
\p
\v 19 For of sadness cometh death, and it overwhelmeth the strength, and the sorrow of the heart boweth down the neck.
\p
\v 20 In withdrawing aside sorrow remaineth: and the substance of the poor is according to his heart.
\p
\v 21 Give not up thy heart to sadness, but drive it from thee: and remember the latter end.

\v 22 Forget it not: for there is no returning, and thou shalt do him no good, and shalt hurt thyself.
\p

\p
\v 3 He glorified him in the sight of kings, and gave him commandments in the sight of his people, and shewed him his glory.
\p
\v 4 He sanctified him in his faith, and meekness, and chose him out of all flesh.
\p
\v 5 For he heard him, and his voice, and brought him into a cloud.
\p
\v 6 And he gave him commandments before his face, and a law of life and instruction, that he might teach Jacob his covenant, and Israel his judgments.
\p
\v 7 He exalted Aaron his brother, and like to himself of the tribe of Levi:
\p
\v 8 He made an everlasting covenant with him, and gave him the priesthood of the nation, and made him blessed in glory,
\p
\v 9 And he girded him about with a glorious girdle, and clothed him with a robe of glory, and crowned him with majestic attire.
\p
\v 10 He put upon him a garment to the feet, and breeches, and an ephod, and he compassed him with many little bells of gold all round about,
\p
\v 11 That as he went there might be a sound, and a noise made that might be heard in the temple, for a memorial to the children of his people.
\p
\v 12 He gave him a holy robe of gold, and blue, and purple, a woven work of a wise man, endued with judgment and truth:
\p
\v 13 Of twisted scarlet the work of an artist, with precious stones cut and set in gold, and graven by the work of a lapidary for a memorial, according to the number of the tribes of Israel.
\p
\v 14 And a crown of gold upon his mitre wherein was engraved Holiness, an ornament of honour: a work of power, and delightful to the eyes for its beauty.
\p
\v 15 Before him there were none so beautiful, even from the beginning.
\p
\v 16 No stranger was ever clothed with them, but only his children alone, and his grandchildren for ever.
\p
\v 17 His sacrifices were consumed with fire every day.
\p
\v 18 Moses filled his hands and anointed him with holy oil.
\p
\v 19 This was made to him for an everlasting testament, and to his seed as the days of heaven, to execute the office of the priesthood, and to have praise, and to glorify his people in his name.
\p
\v 20 He chose him out of all men living, to offer sacrifice to God, incense, and a good savour, for a memorial to make reconciliation for his people:
\p
\v 21 And he gave him power in his commandments, in the covenants of his judgments, that he should teach Jacob his testimonies, and give light to Israel in his law.
\p
\v 22 And strangers stood up against him, and through envy the men that were with Dathan and Abiron, compassed him about in the wilderness, and the congregation of Core in their wrath.
\p
\v 23 The Lord God saw and it pleased him not, and they were consumed in his wrathful indignation.
\p
\v 24 He wrought wonders upon them, and consumed them with a flame of fire.
\p
\v 25 And he added glory to Aaron, and gave him an inheritance, and divided unto him the firstfruits of the increase of the earth.
\p
\v 26 He prepared them bread in the first place unto fulness: for the sacrifices also of the Lord they shall eat, which he gave to him, and to his seed.
\p
\v 27 But he shall not inherit among the people in the land, and he hath no portion among the people: for he himself is his portion and inheritance.
\p
\v 28 Phinees the son of Eleazar is the third in glory, by imitating him in the fear of the Lord:
\p
\v 29 And he stood up in the shameful fall of the people: in the goodness and readiness of his soul he appeased God for Israel.
\p
\v 30 Therefore he made to him a covenant of peace, to be the prince of the sanctuary, and of his people, that the dignity of priesthood should be to him and to his seed for ever.

\p
\v 10 And they two being appointed, were delivered out of the danger from among the number of six hundred thousand men on foot, to bring them into their inheritance, into the land that floweth with milk and honey.

\p
\v 3 He played with lions as with lambs: and with bears he did in like manner as with the lambs of the flock, in his youth.
\p
\v 4 Did not he kill the giant, and take away reproach from his people?
\p
\v 5 In lifting up his hand, with the stone in the sling he beat down the boasting of Goliath:
\p
\v 6 For he called upon the Lord the Almighty, and he gave strength in his right hand, to take away the mighty warrior, and to set up the horn of his nation.
\p
\v 7 So in ten thousand did he glorify him, and praised him in the blessings of the Lord, in offering to him a crown of glory:
\p
\v 8 For he destroyed the enemies on every side, and extirpated the Philistines the adversaries unto this day: he broke their horn for ever.
\p
\v 9 In all his works he gave thanks to the holy one, and to the most High, with words of glory.
\p
\v 10 With his whole heart he praised the Lord, and loved God that made him: and he gave him power against his enemies:
\p
\v 11 And he set singers before the altar, and by their voices he made sweet melody.
\p
\v 12 And to the festivals he added beauty, and set in order the solemn times even to the end of his life, that they should praise the holy name of the Lord, and magnify the holiness of God in the morning.
\p
\v 13 The Lord took away his sins, and exalted his horn for ever: and he gave him a covenant of the kingdom, and a throne of glory in Israel.
\p
\v 14 After him arose up a wise son, and for his sake he cast down all the power of the enemies.
\p
\v 15 Solomon reigned in days of peace, and God brought all his enemies under him, that he might build a house in his name, and prepare a sanctuary for ever: O how wise wast thou in thy youth!
\p
\v 16 And thou wast filled as a river with wisdom, and thy soul covered the earth.
\p
\v 17 And thou didst multiply riddles in parables: thy name went abroad to the islands far off, and thou wast beloved in thy peace.
\p
\v 18 The countries wondered at thee for thy canticles, and proverbs, and parables, and interpretations,
\p
\v 19 And at the name of the Lord God, whose surname is, God of Israel.
\p
\v 20 Thou didst gather gold as copper, and didst multiply silver as lead,
\p
\v 21 And thou didst bow thyself to women: and by thy body thou wast brought under subjection.

\v 22 Thou hast stained thy glory, and defiled thy seed so as to bring wrath upon thy children, and to have thy folly kindled,

\p
\v 12 For we live only in our life, but after death our name shall not be such.

\p
\v 14 No word could overcome him, and after death his body prophesied.
\p
\v 15 In his life he did great wonders, and in death he wrought miracles.

\p
\v 22 And they called upon the Lord who is merciful, and spreading their hands, they lifted them up to heaven: and the holy Lord God quickly heard their voice.
\p
\v 23 He was not mindful of their sins, neither did he deliver them up to their enemies, but he purified them by the hand of Isaias, the holy prophet.
\p
\v 24 He overthrew the army of the Assyrians, and the angel of the Lord destroyed them.
\p
\v 25 For Ezechias did that which pleased God, and walked valiantly in the way of David his father, which Isaias, the great prophet, and faithful in the sight of God, had commanded him.
\p
\v 26 In his days the sun wen backward, and he lengthened the king's life.

\v 7 From the depth of the belly of hell, and from an unclean tongue, and from lying words, from an unjust king, and from a slanderous tongue:
\p
\v 8 My soul shall praise the Lord even to death.
\p
\v 9 And my life was drawing near to hell beneath.
\p
\v 10 They compassed me on every side, and there was no one that would help me. I looked for the succour of men, and there was none.
\p
\v 11 I remembered thy mercy, O Lord, and thy works, which are from the beginning of the world.
\p
\v 12 How thou deliverest them that wait for thee, O Lord, and savest them out of the hands of the nations.
\p
\v 13 Thou hast exalted my dwelling place upon the earth and I have prayed for death to pass away.
\p
\v 14 I called upon the Lord, the father of my Lord, that he would not leave me in the day of my trouble, and in the time of the proud without help.
\p
\v 15 I will praise thy name continually, and will praise it with thanksgiving, and my prayer was heard.
\p
\v 16 And thou hast saved me from destruction, and hast delivered me from the evil time.
\p
\v 17 Therefore I will give thanks, and praise thee, and bless the name of the Lord.
\p
\v 18 When I was yet young, before I wandered about, I sought for wisdom openly in my prayer.
\p
\v 19 I prayed for her before the temple, and unto the very end I will seek after her, and she flourished as a grape soon ripe.
\p
\v 20 My heart delighted in her, my foot walked in the right way, from my youth up I sought after her.
\p
\v 21 I bowed down my ear a little, and received her.
\p
\v 22 I found much wisdom in myself, and profited much therein.
\p
\v 23 To him that giveth me wisdom, will I give glory.
\p
\v 24 For I have determined to follow her: I have had a zeal for good, and shall not be confounded.
\p
\v 25 My soul hath wrestled for her, and in doing it I have been confirmed.
\p
\v 26 I stretched forth my hands on high, and I bewailed my ignorance of her.
\p
\v 27 I directed my soul to her, and in knowledge I found her.
\p
\v 28 I possessed my heart with her from the beginning: therefore I shall not be forsaken.
\p
\v 29 My entrails were troubled in seeking her: therefore shall I possess a good possession.
\p
\v 30 The Lord hath given me a tongue for my reward: and with it I will praise him.
\p
\v 31 Draw near to me, ye unlearned, and gather yourselves together into the hours of discipline.
\p
\v 32 Why are ye slow and what do you say of these things? your souls are exceeding thirsty.
\p
\v 33 I have opened my mouth, and have spoken: buy her for yourselves without silver,
\p
\v 34 And submit your neck to the yoke, and let your soul receive discipline: for she is near at hand to be found.
\p
\v 35 Behold with your eyes how I have laboured a little, and have found much rest to myself.
\p
\v 36 Receive ye discipline as a great sum of money, and possess abundance of gold by her.
\p
\v 37 Let your soul rejoice in his mercy and you shall not be confounded in his praise.
\p
\v 38 Work your work before the time, and he will give you your reward in his time.
